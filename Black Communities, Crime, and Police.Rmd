## Introduction
  The BLM movement and the demand for equal justice for Black people have been growing exponentially since the tragic incident of George Floyd. Inspired by the BLM, I believe the scientific study and analysis of the data sets recording police interactions with the public and the crime rates in Black communities can support Black activism by highlighting the racial discrimination against Black people. This project aims to answer three important questions: What is the racial distribution of the victims and the perpetrators of homicide crimes in the U.S? What is the influence of race on the victims of police shootings?  Is there a racial discrimination against Black people when it comes to the drivers stopped by police and the duration of their stop? To answer the aforementioned questions, I plan to analyze four data sets. The first data set has a record for all police shootings since 2000, including the race and gender of the victim. The second data set has a detailed record for every homicide case in the US from 1980 to 2014, including gender and race of both the victim and perpetrator.  The third data set has a record of all police stops in Rhode Island from 2005 to 2015. The police stops are limited to Rhode Island only due to the size of the data; there are 200 million police stops recorded across the U.S, so analyzing such data sets is beyond the scope of this project. The fourth data set is a census of every county and state in the U.S by race and ethnicity. 
  
  The project found that there is a disproportionate ratio between the percentage of Black perpetrators of homicide crimes in the U.S and the percentage of Black people in the U.S population. Similarly, there is an even more skewed ratio between the percentage of Black victims of homicide crimes in the U.S and the proportion of Black people in the U.S population. Thus, the answer to the first question shows that Black communities are considerably vulnerable to crimes. The findings, also, showed that over one fifth of police shootings victims were Black even though the proportion of Black people in the U.S population is less than 15%.  Furthermore, not only were the proportion of Black drivers stopped by the police in Rhode Island far more than the percentage of Black people in the state but also the Black drivers were stopped for longer duration compared to White drivers. The answers to the second and third questions underlines the unjust treatment of Black people by the police across the U.S.
    
    
    
## Data Source

US Police Shootings: https://fatalencounters.org/
The data was first crowdsourced and validated by comparing the data to public media reports. Then, the organization hired paid researchers to collect data from reliable sources, such as the LA Times Homicide report. Furthermore, the organization collected data directly from law enforcement agencies, requesting over 2300 public records of state, federal and local law enforcement agencies. 

Homicide Reports, 1980-2014: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murderaccountability/homicide-reports
The data was collected directly from the FBI master files of the Uniform Crime Reportâ€™s "Return A", which has a summary of the homicide crimes in the U.S that ended with the arrest of the perpetrator, and the FBI's original Supplementary Homicide Report, which records the details of every homicide crime in the U.S since 1976.

Stanford Open Policing Project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faressayah/stanford-open-policing-project
The data was collected by Stanford Computational Policy Lab in collaboration with Big Local News by making public record requests of state and local police departments.

Population by Race and Ethnicity: https://www.statsamerica.org/downloads/default.aspx
The source of the data is the U.S Census Bureau, which collects data from federal, state, and local governments; in addition, some of the data is collected directly from citizens through surveys. Data sources include federal agencies, such as the IRS, and commercial businesses working on data collection. The data on race and ethnicity are based on self-identification.

## Data Ethics

The analysis of the data brings light to the racial discrimination against Black communities in multiple areas, police interactions and homicide rates. The provision of accurate data regarding this matter is the basis of the intervention to achieve social efficiency, which is an ethically important gain. The analysis of the racial distribution of police shootings and police stops should impel police departments across the U.S to adopt better institutional policies to combat this racial bias, which is an ethically important gain. Highlighting the skewed ratio between the percentage of Black people in the population and the percentage of Black homicide victims and perpetrators develops our human understanding of the issue and lets us act more wisely to provide more safety to Black communities, which is another ethically important gain.

 The data collected by the U.S Census Bureau, Stanford Open Policing Project, and the Murder Accountability Project avoids any harm to privacy and security because the data is anonymous in contrast to the data of police shootings, which has the full name of the victims. The data of the police shootings can be used to link the victims of police shootings to their family members using the full name of the victim; if the data was used in such a manner, the family members may be treated unfairly because they are linked to potentially dangerous criminals who were shot by the police, which is an ethically significant harm. Furthermore, this can lead the relatives of the victims to experience reputational or emotional harm, which are ethically significant harms.

### - Data Modelling 


```{r}
#creates training data out of the original data after selecting the even years
Homicide_And_US_Race_training <- Homicide_And_US_Race %>% filter(Year %% 2 == 0)

#finds whether Black or White is the highest possibility for the race of a homicide victim
mean(Homicide_And_US_Race_training$Black_Percentage_victim)
mean(Homicide_And_US_Race_training$White_Percentage_victim)
```
The average percentage of a homicide victim being black is higher than any other race. Thus, the baseline model is that for every state, the majority of homicide victims are black.




```{r}
#creates test data by selecting the odd years and grouping the homicide victims by states

#adds the result of the test to the tibble
homicide_test1 <- homicide_test %>% mutate(Black_majority = ifelse(max(Asian_Percentage_victim, Black_Percentage_victim, Native_Percentage_victim, Unspecified_Percentage_victim, White_Percentage_victim, na.rm = TRUE) == Black_Percentage_victim, 1, 0))

#checks for who many states was the model correct
sum(homicide_test1$Black_majority, na.rm = TRUE)

```
The base model is true for 21 states. Black is the most likely race of a homicide victim is 21 states even though only D.C has a black majority.




## Conclusion


The findings show that from 1990 to 2014, over 45% of the victims and 30% of the perpetrators of homicide crime in the U.S are Black even though the percentage of Black people in the U.S didn't exceed 15%, which demonstrates that Black communities are rife with crimes in contrast to White communities. Furthermore, in 21 states, the most likely race for the victim of Homicide is Black even though only D.C had a Black majority during the years of the study. In addition, over 20% of police shootings victims each year from 2000 to 2019 were Black, and the percentage was as high as 30% in 2012. In Rhode Island, the percentage of drivers stopped by the police who are Black are as high as double the proportion of Black people in the population of Rhode Island; furthermore, Black drivers were stopped for longer duration than non-Black drivers. For instance, 5% of the Black drivers were stopped by the police for more than 30 minutes compared to 3% of White drivers. These findings illustrate that Black people are targeted by the police at unjustified rates and underscores how Black communities are prone to the most dangerous crime, homicide. 

The analysis of the police stops in Rhode Island is limited in its span and canâ€™t be generalized to all the United States. Also, one of my aims was to visualize the trend in racial bias in homicide, police shootings, and police stops across the time frame of each dataset. However, the years 1980 to 1989 in the homicide data set were omitted after joining the homicide and the Census Bureau data sets because the census data set didnâ€™t have data for the U.S population from 1980 to 1990.  A next step might be working with more comprehensive data, such as a U.S census data set that includes all the years since 1980 and a data set of police stops across all the United States.
